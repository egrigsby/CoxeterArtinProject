# CoxeterArtinProject
Exploring how transformers and other architectures handle the word problem in Coxeter and Artin groups

Questions to guide us:
(0) What is a Coxeter group? What are the different ways of presenting a Coxeter group algebraically? What do these algebraic presentations represent geometrically?
(1) What is a regular language? 
(2) What is the language of reduced expressions in a Coxeter group?
(3) What is a finite state automaton? What is a transformation semigroup of a finite state automaton?
(4) What is the finite state automaton that recognizes the language of reduced expressions in Coxeter groups? 
(5) What is the transformation semigroup of this finite state automaton?
